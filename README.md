# SmartAi
A smart camera surveillance that can detect accident on roads(mainly on highways) where truck or large vehicle accident happens and automate the ambulance process.

# Problem statement

The problem smartAi solves is now a days we have seen that in many road accident people died because of late ambulance services.So we proposed our idea to automate this process of ambulance getting on that location.

# Our solution

1. It can help stop bullying of teachers in online classes by recording movements of students.
2. It will automatically mark the attendance of people using FaceNet paper algorithm which will save other's time.
3. It contains a dashboard like system that takes less bandwidth and will share coordinates of designs and drawings in the pdf's that would be taught."
