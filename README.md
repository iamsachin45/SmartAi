# SmartAi
A smart camera surveillance that can detect accident on roads(mainly on highways) where truck or large vehicle accident happens and automate the ambulance process.

# Problem statement

The problem smartAi solves is now a days we have seen that in many road accident people died because of late ambulance services.So we proposed our idea to automate this process of ambulance getting on that location.

# Our solution

1. It can help to save people  life from road Accident.
2. If any accident occur it will automatically detect the accident and it will send google map Location to nearby hospital.
3. Hospital will  accept the request and send the Ambulance to that Location.
4. The Ambulance driver can open the google map link recieved in email ann reach to  the location.
